# Cars
This is a group project from our Regression Analysis Class. The data was downloaded from Kaggle.

Motivation for this project: 
We are required to model the price of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary
with the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. Further, the model will 
be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

Summary: We cleaned the dataset(by manually changing character data to factored and fixing mispelled data) , checked for multicollinearity by using heat map, 
used backwards stepwise regression to select our best model, introduced interaction terms manually(choose model), checked the 4 conditions of MLR(we transformed
our predictor using boxcox), and finally checked for outliers(no outliers).
Group members: Gerry Cruz,Yushan Zhao, and Kierra Manuel.
